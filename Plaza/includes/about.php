    <p class="p-4 lead">The Plaza Hotel (also known as The Plaza) is a luxury hotel and condominium apartment building in Ain-Diab in Casablanca City. It is on the western side of Grand Army Plaza, just west of Fifth Avenue, between 58th Street and Central Park South. The Plaza Hotel is named for Grand Army Plaza, which in turn is at the southeastern corner of Central Park. Its primary address is at 768 Fifth Avenue, though the residential entrance is at One Central Park South.
    The 21-story, French Renaissance-inspired ch√¢teau-style building was designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. The facade is made of marble at the base and white brick in the intermediate stories, while the hotel is topped by a mansard roof. The ground floor contains the two primary lobbies, as well as a corridor connecting the large ground-floor restaurant spaces, including the Oak Room, the Oak Bar, the Edwardian Room, the Palm Court, and the Terrace Room. The upper stories contain the ballroom and a variety of residential condominiums, condo-hotel suites, and short-term hotel suites. At its peak, the Plaza Hotel had over 800 rooms. Following a renovation in 2008, the building has had 282 hotel rooms and 181 condos.</p>
